Bitcoin Mining

Hello, I am working on learning programming for a multitude of reasons, Bitcoin mining seems interesting to me at the moment 
and researching further has brought me to GitHub which I find to be a very interesting platform with a plethora of possiblities
I look forward to learning all there is about code and programming.
